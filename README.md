ODEVisualization
================

ODEVisualization is a C++/Thrust/Cuda library that has a focus on fast evaluation of high-dimensional sets of ordinary differential equations on a GPU.

The library can be used to:

- Find and valuate fixed points (attractive and repulsive) in the high-dimensional flow field.
- Visualise two dimensional views of the high-dimensional flow field.
- Integrate the set of ODEs.

Support and Development
