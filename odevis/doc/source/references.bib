	abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach to the topological analysis of four‐dimensional vector fields. In analogy to traditional 2D and 3D vector field topology, we provide a classification and visual representation of critical points, together with a technique for extracting their invariant manifolds. For effective exploration of the resulting four‐dimensional structures, we present a 4D camera that provides concise representation by exploiting projection degeneracies, and a 4D clipping approach that avoids self‐intersection in the 3D projection. We exemplify the properties and the utility of our approach using specific synthetic cases.}

The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions."
